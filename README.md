# Model-to-predict-the-fuel-efficiency-of-automobiles
-- This project explores the Auto-MPG dataset and builds a linear regression model to predict mpg (miles per gallon) based on automobile features.
-- Steps

Data Preprocessing:

Removed duplicates and handled missing values.

Converted horsepower to numeric and dropped invalid rows.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Correlation matrix and pairplots for key features (mpg, cylinders, displacement, weight).

Model Building:

Used LinearRegression from Scikit-learn.

Split data into training and test sets (80-20 split).

Model Evaluation:

Predicted test set values and visualized residuals using a distribution plot.
